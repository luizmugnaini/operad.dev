Remember when personal websites had lists of selected links that you could use to navigate the web
and find cool content? Let's bring this culture back! Here is my little contribution to that:

# Programming

- [Casey Muratori's blog](https://caseymuratori.com/contents). I specially recommend reading the
  [Semantic Compression](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015) post.
- Handmade Hero [episode guide](https://guide.handmadehero.org/code/), absolutely amazing series
  building a game from the ground up - made by Casey Muratori.
- [Computer, Enhance!](https://www.computerenhance.com) Another project from Casey Muratori,
  teaching all the nooks and crannies of low-level computing.
- [Fabrice Bellard's website](https://bellard.org/), the creator of FFMPEG, QEMU, as well as
  TinyCC and QuickJS - this guy is a legend.
- Glenn Fiedler old blog [Gaffer On Games](https://gafferongames.com) and his new blog
  [Más Bandwidth](https://mas-bandwidth.com) - both provide very good resources for many game
  development topics. Glenn also has a cool channel where he talks about
  netcode, [Network Next](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkNext).
- [Mr. 4th Lab](https://mr4th.com/blog), by Alan Webster.
- [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html).
- [Inigo Quilez's blog](https://iquilezles.org/).
- [Ryan Fleury's blog](https://www.rfleury.com).
- [Andre Weissflog's blog](https://floooh.github.io).
- [Andrew Kelley's blog](https://andrewkelley.me/), the creator of the Zig programming language.
- [gingerBill's blog](https://www.gingerbill.org), the creator of the Odin programming language.
- [Our Machinery archived blog](https://ruby0x1.github.io/machinery_blog_archive).
- [Molecular Matters blog](https://blog.molecular-matters.com/).
- [Wicked Engine's devblog](https://wickedengine.net/category/devblog/).
- [Randy's list](https://randy.gg/res/), yet another list of cool resources for you to browse.
- [Drew DeVault's blog](https://drewdevault.com/).
- [Fabian 'Ryg' Giesen's blog](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com), a wizard from RAD tools and the demoscene days.
- [Andreas Fredriksson's blog](https://deplinenoise.wordpress.com). Seems to be stale unfortunately,
  but has many posts packed with knowledge.
- [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/), from Amid Patel. I recommend the posts about
  terrain generation, really good stuff.
- [Arseny Kapoulkine's blog](https://zeux.io), computer graphics and stuff.
- [Bartosz Taudul's blog](https://wolf.nereid.pl), creator of the Tracy frame profiler and other
  good tools.
- [Ignacio Castaño's blog](https://www.ludicon.com/castano/blog/) on texture compression, graphics
  and game development.
- [Andreas Fredriksson's blog](https://deplinenoise.wordpress.com/). This is a stale blog as far as
  I know, but there are interesting posts there.
- [Bartoz Taudul's blog](https://wolf.nereid.pl), the creator of the Tracy frame profiler.

# Researchers
