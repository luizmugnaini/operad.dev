Hello there! I'm Luiz, a Brazilian programmer and a Master's student in Computer Science at the
University of Sao Paulo (USP). Oh and I currently work at Amazon.

My interests are very diverse, and currently I focus mostly in pure/applied mathematics, computer
graphics and game development.

I love to implement stuff from scratch, mostly in C and C++. I also sometimes do some scripting in
Python and Lua.

I'm currently researching discrete differential geometry and its applications to computer graphics,
together with my supervisor [Sinai Robins](https://sites.google.com/site/sinairobins).

Previously, I've done some research in pure mathematics. More specifically, together with my advisor
[Ivan Struchiner](https://www.ime.usp.br/~ivanstru), we studied [_abstract homotopy theory_](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+theory)
via [_model categories_](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+category). You can find my academic CV
[here](/academic-cv.pdf).

Feel free to explore my blog and connect with me. I'm always eager to exchange some cool ideas.
